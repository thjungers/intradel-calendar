# Intradel Calendar

This repository generates and hosts .ics calendars for Intradel waste collection.

# How to use

File [calendar_links.md](./calendar_links.md) compiles the links to the available calendars, per municipality, as well as a link to the PDF calendar that was used as the source.

To subscribe to a calendar, right-click and copy the corresponding link. Then, paste the link in your calendar app.

You may also click the link to download the .ics file and import it in your calendar app. However, doing so, the calendar will not be updated automatically.
